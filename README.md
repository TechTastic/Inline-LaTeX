**Inline: LaTeX** adds the ability to use and display complex mathematical formulas formatted with **[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)** and handled by **[Inline](https://modrinth.com/mod/inline)**!

## How to Use:
You simply use `[latex:<formula>]`, that's it!  
An example for if you used `[latex:E=mc^2]` is provided below:  
![Rendering of E=mc^2 using LaTeX](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{300}\fg{FFFFFF}E=mc^2)

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Displaying_a_formula) is a helpful formatting guide and [here](https://editor.codecogs.com/home) is the API used for the formula images!

## Known Issues
- Glowing text seems to not fully encase the formula
- Using the `+` and `!` delimiters for scaling does not properly scale the image
